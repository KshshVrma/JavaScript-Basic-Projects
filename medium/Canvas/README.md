# Hacktoberfest 2022 - JavaScript Easy Programs

## Canvas

### Description
The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.
In this project I've created the canvas on which anyone can draw something with their cursor. While drawing, the color and thickness of the pen changes automatically.
